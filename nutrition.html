                        <p class="lead">Your food choices affect your mood and how you feel today, tomorrow, next week,
                            next month, etc. How do you feel after eating a whole pizza and ice cream at 2:00pm when you
                            still
                            have a lot to do throughout the day. Awful? Yeah, I thought so. From those meals, you not
                            only had 3000+ calories, but
                            your body
                            will now force you not to move the rest of the day, and this could even spill into the next
                            day. Poor
                            eating habits can lead to many health risks, diseases, and even death. <br><br>
                            Good nutrition is an important part of leading a healthy lifestyle. Combined with physical
                            activity,
                            your diet can help you to reach and maintain a healthy body weight, reduce your risk of
                            chronic
                            diseases
                            (like heart disease and cancer), and promote your overall health. Making small changes to
                            your eating habits
                            can make you smarter, think clearer, treat others better, gives you less stress, and the
                            list
                            goes on. The best
                            part is that it is much easier than you think, and if you are like me, you will find
                            yourself eating more but
                            feeling better and happier.

                        <p class="lead">Eating whole foods, not the actual store whole foods, can provide many positive
                            benefits to your
                            eating habits and can make a world of a difference when it comes to your mood and how you
                            are feeling. A few examples
                            would be to eat skinless chicken breasts instead of processed chicken nuggets. Drinking a
                            smoothie with yogurt,
                            blueberries, a banana, and granola, instead of a blue slushie or icee from the ice cream
                            parlor. Eating a bowl of fruit
                            in the morning with your eggs instead of a strawberry toaster strudle. You get the point by
                            now. This small change in
                            your everyday eating habits will make your skin clearer, keep you fuller, in some instances
                            taste better, is less expensive,
                            and the list continues. Yes it may take an extra 10 minutes to prepare, but these extra
                            minutes of preparation will be
                            nothing when your body is much stronger and well-nourished and can function for another 20
                            years. You don't have to dive deep into the different vitamins, and the micronutrients
                            the food is providing. Just by making this small change you will almost instantly start to
                            feel the benefits as you finish your meal.
                            You can't tell me that drinking a smoothie with fresh fruit and yogurt makes you feel worse
                            than having a berry ice cream or a
                            processed fruit gummy snack. You already know you always have more than just one snack too,
                            which leads to an even worse feeling.
                            Make the change today, and tell me how you feel.

                    <h1 class="ws-colorw">Understanding <span class="ws-colory">Calories In vs Calories Out</span></h3>
                        <p class="lead">Your body uses calories to maintain life each and every day. They are required
                            to walk, talk,
                            breathe, sleep, digest liquids and foods, workout, etc. The amount of calories your body
                            requires on a daily basis is
                            determined by your sex, height, weight, and physical activity levels. Lets's say your body
                            requires 2,500 calories a day
                            based off of the factors I had listed above, and you eat 3,000 calories for 7 days in a row.
                            The extra 500 calories you
                            are eating each day are being stored away in your body as an energy source to be used at a
                            later time when needed. After 7
                            days go by, your body now has 3,500 extra calories stored away which equates to about 1lb of
                            body weight. Now you may ask
                            if this 1lb is fat, muscle, or something else? Most of it will be stored as fat, and a small
                            percentage will be turned into muscle
                            if you are strength training and feeding your body the correct macronutrients which we will
                            get into. This repetitive 500 calorie
                            surplus will eventually lead into a large surplus of weight gained over time which will lead
                            you into poor health risks.
                            <br><br>
                            *Note* 1 lb = 3,500 calories
                            <br><br>
                            Now let's say you ate the required 2,500 calories each day, then that means your body will
                            not be storing any extra calories which
                            will result in your body weight staying neutral or the same. Now you may ask, "What will
                            happen if you did the opposite, and eat less
                            calories then required?" If you are eating 2,000 calories a day when your body requires
                            2,500, over that 7 day period your body will
                            lose approximately 1lb of body weight. Similar to before, that 1lb will mainly be fat lost,
                            and a small percentage could result in muscle
                            if the body is not being fed the correct nutrients.
                            <br><br>
                            You may ask, how do I know how many calories I should eat based off of the factors you
                            listed above?

                            <br><br>Our first objective would be to find your BMR which is your (basal metabolic rate),
                            or
                            in simpler terms, the amount of calories your
                            body needs if you were to lay down and not move for a 24 hour period. No bathroom, no
                            talking, no moving any body part.
                            We don't want to stop there, because nobody lives there life quite like that. Our next step
                            is to find the amount of calories burned
                            with your daily activities included, walking, breathing, exercising, fidgeting, etc. This is
                            called your AMR which is your (active metabollic rate.)
                            Once you have your AMR, your next step is to put it to the test.
                            <br><br>
                            Let's just say your AMR comes out to 2,800 calories. You will want to eat approxiamtely
                            2,800 calories and get as close as possible to that number
                            for accurate results for 7-14 days. This will require weighing yourself during this time
                            period to see how your weight fluctuates. You may see
                            a few lbs difference each day which could be affeted by a numerous amount of factors, but if
                            your weight stays the same come the end of that time period
                            then now you know 2,800 calories is how much you need to maintain your body
                            weight.
                            <br><br>From here, I would recommend if you want to lose weight, you do it at a slow rate
                            and only drop your calorie intake by 500 which would bring your intake
                            down to 2,300. Now if you are losing over 1-2lbs of body weight a week you may want to
                            increase your calories a small bit so you don't lose too much too fast.
                            This could hqppen by your body losing not only fat but more muscle than you expect.
                            <br><br>
                            Now if you want to add on weight or get stronger I would recommend adding on 200-300
                            calories on top of your 2,800 which would bring you to 3000-3100.
                            If you are implementing a smart workout routine you will also notice your muscles becoming
                            stronger during your workouts and you will be able to lift
                            more weight and more frequently.
                            <br><br> I find that the following website is the easiest & simplest way to find these
