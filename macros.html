                    <h1 class="ws-colorw">What are<span class="ws-colory"> Macros or Macronutrients?</span></h3>
                        <p class="lead">Calories are broken down into what we call, Macronutrients. Macronutrients, or
                            as some people call them "macros" are the building blocks of nutrition. They are better
                            known as protein, carbohydrates, and fat. They are the detailed version of calories and are
                            the nutrients your body needs to build a well-nourished and healthy body.
                            <br><br>
                            All foods that you eat are made up of a combination of these three. Each macro has its
                            purpose and functionality when it comes to what it does
                            to your body. Below is a breakdown of what each nutrient does.
                            <br><br>
                            Total Calories = Protein + Carbohydrates + Fat
                            <br><br>

                            <span class="ws-colory"> <strong>Protein:</strong></span> Is the "muscle building"
                            nutrient. It helps to
                            build and repair muscles, organs,
                            skin, blood and different chemicals, like hormones, in your body. Large amounts are commonly
                            found in meat, poultry, fish, dairy, and eggs. Other foods such as nuts, seeds, and whole
                            grains also contain protein but in smaller amounts.
                            <br><br>
                            A common rule of thumb is to have 1g of protein per lb of body weight for optimal muscle
                            growth.
                            <br>
                            Example: If you weigh 200lbs you want to hit 195g - 205g protein daily.
                            <br><br>

                            <span class="ws-colory"> <strong>Carbohydrates:</strong></span> This nutrient provides fuel,
                            the energy for your body and brain. Potatoes, breads, rice & pasta are packed with large
                            amounts of carbohydrates. Carbs are also found in all plant foods, fruits,
                            vegetables, legumes, milk, and yogurt.
                            <br><br>
                            A common rule of thumb is to let your carbohydrates take up anywhere between 40% - 50%
                            of your daily caloric intake.
                            <br><br>
                            Example: If you eat 2,500 calories a day, you want to take in 1,000 -
                            1,250 calories of carbs.
                            <br><br>

                            <span class="ws-colory"> <strong>Fats:</strong></span> This nutrient insulates and protects
                            your bones and organs, acts as backup fuel for energy like carbs, and helps in brain
                            development. Healthy, unsaturated fats are found in oils, avocados, any type of nuts, seeds,
                            and some fatty fish, such as salmon, sardines, and mackeral. Unhealthy saturated fats are
                            found in high-fat beef, pork, butter, full-fat diary, and processed foods, such as cookies
                            and donuts. <span class="ws-colory">(Please note, eating unhealthy saturated fats will not
                                ruin your eating habits
                                or break your diet. In life, we have cravings, and it is totally okay to eat these, just
                                not
                                in large amounts or very frequently.)</span>
                            <br><br>
                            A common rule of thumb is to let your fats take up approximately 25%
                            of your daily caloric intake.
                            <br>
                            Example: If you eat 2,500 calories a day, you want your fats to take up about 625 calories
                            of
                            your total calories.

                    <h1 class="ws-colorw">How / Why should you track your <span class="ws-colory"> Macros?</span></h1>
                    <p class="lead">Many people ask, why should I start tracking my Macros? Knowing the correct
                        amount of macronutrients your body needs to set yourself up for success is step 1 to
                        achieving your health & fitness vision. By setting a goal for
                        exactly how many grams of protein, carbohydrates, and fat you should consume each day,
                        you're setting yourself up for a better weight-loss or weight-gain success. (Depending on
                        your goals.) Unlike restrictive diets or meal plans, counting macros allows you to have more
                        flexibilty, potentially enabling you to have success with a wider range of foods. Meal plans
                        can tire you out by eating the same bland foods day in and day out forcing you to "cheat" on
                        your plan.
                        <br><br>
                        Counting your macros is a whole lot easier than you think it is and you will soon realize it
                        takes up no time of your day.

                        <h4 class="ws-colory">1. Figuring out your daily calorie intake</h4>
                        <p class="lead">Just like we discussed before, finding your BMR / AMR will give you a close to
                            accurate
                            estimate as to how many calories you need daily based off of your sex, height, weight, and
                            activity levels.
                            <br> I find that the following website is the easiest & simplest way to find these numbers:
                            <br> <a class="calorieCalc" href="https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html"
                                target="_blank">https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html</a>
                            <br>
                            This website will give you your BMR and AMR. Now remember, your AMR will give you the amount
                            of calories your body requires on a daily basis through your activity levels.</p>

                        <br><br>
                        <h4 class="ws-colory">2. Decide your macronutrient breakdown</h4>
                        <p class="lead">Remember as we had discussed before, the amount of protein should be equal
                            to 1g per lb
                            of body weight. Your carbohydrates and fats can be split upon the rest of your calories.
                            Look at the following breakdown to use as a general rule of thumb:
                            <br><br>
                            Example:
                            <br>
                            Person 1 = 200lbs & AMR(daily calorie intake) = 2,500 calories
                            <br><br></p>
                        <h6>Protein:</h6>
                        <p class="lead">1g per 1lb of body weight. 200lbs = 200g protein
                            <br>
                            1g of Protein = 4 calories
                            <br>
                            200lbs = 200g Protein.
                            <br>
                            200g * 4 calories per gram = 800 calories.
                            <br>
                            2,500 calories - 800 calories = 1,700 calories left for Carbs & fats
                            <br><br></p>
                        <h6>Carbohydrates:</h6>
                        <p class="lead">1g of Carbohydrates = 4 calories
                            <br>
                            For this example we will say 40% of total calories will take up carbs.
                            <br>
                            2,500 calories * .4 = 1,000 calories Carbohydrates
                            <br>
                            1,000 calories / 4 calories per gram = 250g of carbohydrates
                            <br>
                            1,700 calories - 1,000 calories = 700 calories left for Fats
                            <br><br></p>
                        <h6>Fats:</h6>
                        <p class="lead">1g of Fats = 9 calories
                            <br>
                            Now we have 700 calories left for fats, so all you have to do is divide the two numbers.
                            <br>
                            700 calories left / 9 calories per gram = 77g of fat
                            <br>
                            <br></p>
                        <h4>Your Macronutrient Breakdown will be:</h4>
                        <br>
                        <h5>Protein: 200g</h5>
                        <h5>Carbohydrates: 250g</h5>
                        <h5>Fats: 77g</h5>
                        <br>
                        <p class="lead">*Side Note* When it comes to your fat and carbohydrates, they are both used for
                            fuel, so if
                            you want to have higher carbs and lower fat that is perfectly ok. OR if you want to go
                            higher fats and lower carbs that is also perfectly ok. What ever works best with your body,
                            and makes you feel the best.</p>
