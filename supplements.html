                        <p class="lead"> When it comes to fitness, many people do not know what supplements are or which
                            ones to take which is totally understandable because it can be overwhelming. The word
                            "Supplement" is defined as, "somehing that completes or enhances something else when added
                            to it." Supplements are not the magic ingredient to becoming stronger in the gym, or losing
                            weight faster, they can help the process in a small way if used correctly. Using certain
                            supplements can help you get the most out of trainng in the gym, such as higher energy
                            levels, and a better level of focus. Taking un-researched supplements or supplements in high
                            doses could be extremely bad for your health and body so be careful when doing so.

                    <h1 class="ws-colorw">What supplements<span class="ws-colory"> should I be taking?</span></h3>
                        <p class="lead"> Below are the supplements I take, and the top recommended to take with plenty
                            of backed up research behind them and why people use them.</p> <br><br>

                        <h3 class="ws-colory">1. Creatine</h3>
                        <p class="lead">Creatine is a molecule that's produced naturally in your body, and provides
                            energy for your muscles and other tissues. By taking creatine you can increase muscle
                            creatine content by up to 40% beyond its normal levels. This affects your muscle cells and
                            exercise performance, promoting muscle gain. In fact, a large amount of research shows
                            creatine improves muscle strength. Creatine can also increase water content in your muscle
                            cells. This may cause your muscle cells to swell slightly and produce signals for muscle
                            growth. Creatine being the most researched supplement on the market and being the most
                            recommended and helpful is the reason why I have it being my number 1. <br><br>
                            Overall, many researchers have studied creatine supplements and exercise, and one thing is
                            clear — creatine can help increase muscle mass. <br><br>
                            When using creatine, take 5g daily with water and that is all you need to do. Some labels
                            recommend 3 servings of this for the first couple weeks called overloading, but you do not
                            need to do this. This is on the label purely for marketing purposes and to make you go
                            through your container faster to buy more.
                            Also, when supplementing with creatine be sure to drink another 20 - 40 oz of water on
                            top of your already daily intake. </p>

                        <h3 class="ws-colory">2. Protein Supplements</h3>
                        <p class="lead">Getting enough protein is critical for gaining muscle. Specifically, to gain
                            muscle, you need to consume more protein than your body breaks down through natural
                            processes. While it’s possible to get all the protein you need from protein-rich foods, some
                            people struggle to do so. Now remember how I said getting 1g per lb of body weight is a good
                            rule of thumb. If you are struggling to hit this number through eating your food, then a
                            whey protein powder is the perfect solution for you. <br><br>
                            On average a scoop of whey protein powder will give you 20 - 25g of protein, so if you are
                            missing your protein numbers by anywheres from 25 - 50 grams then you would just need 1 - 2
                            scoops of protein to hit that number.<br><br>
                            Protein powder is no magic ingredient to getting tons of muscle and becoming jacked, it is
                            just there to help hit your protein number if you can not hit your number through
                            food.<br><br>
                            1 scoop of whey protein is just about the same thing as 4 ounces of skinless chicken breast.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="ws-colory">3. Branch Chain Amino Acids</h3>
                        <p class="lead"> Branch Chain amino acids (BCAAs) consist of three individual amino acids:
                            leucine, isoleucine and valine. They are found in most protein sources, particularly those
                            of animal origin like meat, poultry, eggs, dairy and fish. BCAAs are critically important
                            for muscle growth and make up about 14% of the amino acids in your muscles. A small amount
                            of research has shown that BCAAs may improve muscle gain or reduce muscle loss, compared to
                            a placebo. <br><br>
                            The only reason I believe you should use BCAAs is when you are working on losing body fat,
                            and you hit a point in your progress where you are starting to lose energy in the gym.
                            Supplementing BCAAs in my own experience helps keep energy levels up, and muscle strength up
                            while working out. </p>

                        <h3 class="ws-colory">4. Pre-Work Out</h3>
                        <p class="lead">Pre workout is in no shape or form something you should take if you do not like
                            the added energy levels. Pre-workout supplements are taken to give you the edge to burn more
                            fat, recover faster, or maximize your performance. The pre-workout you consume can also be
                            tailored to improve a variety of factors such as endurance, strength, or muscle growth. Many
                            pre-workout concoctions are offered as ‘stacks’ or combinations of different nutritional
                            compounds to produce different effects in the user. Providing optimal nutrient intake prior
                            to exercise will not only help you maximize your performance but also minimize muscle
                            damage. <br><br>
                            In my own experience I find that taking pre workout helps me get in the zone while working
                            out at the gym and helps me concentrate on pushing heavier weights while also focusing on
                            form control.
                            <br><br>
                            Preworkouts can also be damaging to your body if consuming too much at once, so be sure to
                            do your research on everything you are taking prior to taking it.</p>

                        <h3 class="ws-colory">5. Multivitamin</h3>
                        <p class="lead">Multivitamins are supplements that contain many different vitamins and minerals,
                            sometimes along with other ingredients. There is no real standard about what constitutes a
                            multivitamin, and their nutrient composition varies by brand and product. They go by several
                            different names, including multivitamins, multiminerals, multis, multiples or simply
                            vitamins. They are available in many forms, such as tablets, capsules, chewable gummies,
                            powders and liquids. Most multivitamins should be taken once or twice a day. Make sure to
                            read the label and follow the recommended dosage instructions. At the end of the day,
                            Multivitamins are supplements that contain many different vitamins and minerals. They are
                            available in various forms. <br><br>
                            You should really only be taking a multivitamin if you are not getting your main sources of
                            vitamins through the foods you eat, but if you are following a realtively clean "diet" or
                            eating habits then you will be getting all the vitamins you need, and there will be no need
                            for a multi.</p>
