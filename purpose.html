                    <div class="col text-center">
                        <p class="lead">Since becoming involved in health & fitness, I noticed my life
                            completely change around for the better, and I want to help as many people have that same
                            vision.</p>
                        <p class="lead">My initial goal was to lose weight and have the muscle definition everyone wants
                            but
                            eventually I learned that there was so much more to working out. After achieving this small
                            goal of mine, I noticed my grades were improving, my personality was changing, I was
                            becoming smarter & wiser, I was thinking more clearly, I was less stressed out, etc.
                            Watching
                            your body change and become something you have always wanted is one of the most rewarding
                            feelings I have ever felt and I want everyone on this planet to feel the same way. </p>
                        <p class="lead">Whether your goal is to lose weight, put on muscle, completely transform your
                            body, improve your overall health, eat cleaner, drink more water, I want to help you achieve
                            this vision of yours. You may have tried and failed many, many times, but never giving up is
                            where you are the strongest. Achieving this vision is about to become a whole lot easier
                            than you ever thought.</p>
                        <p class="lead">I created this website to pin point the main parts of health & fitness and the
                            small daily adjustments you can make to your life to see results and to feel the results in
                            a short amount of time.</p>
                        <p class="lead">I cover different weekly workout splits you can use, the importance of nutrition
                            & hydration. what macros are and how to follow them, and what supplements can help you out
                            along your journey.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Changing your life does not have to be torture, it does not have to be
                            complicated, it does not have to be impossible, it WILL be a lifelong fun journey you take
                            and will never regret taking.
                            <br><br> Please get in contact with me as I would love to help you
