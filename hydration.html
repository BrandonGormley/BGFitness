                    <h1 class="ws-colorw">The Importance of <span class="ws-colory">drinking water?</span></h3>
                        <p class="lead">If you do not know already, our bodies are made up of approximately 60% water.
                            Staying hydrated can provide a numerous amount of benefits, and losing as low as 2% of your
                            bodies water levels, you will start to notice your physical performance fall off. Being
                            hydrated will also help with brain function, preventing headaches, hangovers, and can even
                            help relieve constipation, as well as help treat kidney stones. Staying hydrated can even
                            help provide clearer/brighter skin, by promoting collagen production. If you don't get the
                            point by now, it can help quite a bit, so drink more water.
                            <br><br>
                            Losing weight can become much easier by drinking more water due to your metabolic rate
                            increasing, and your satiety being increased. This will cause you to eat less from being
                            full of water and most of the time your body is thirsty rather than hungry.

                <div class="col mb-4">
                    <h1 class="ws-colorw">How much water should I be<span class="ws-colory"> drinking everyday?</span>
                        </h3>
                        <p class="lead">So now that you know how important "drinking enough" water is, you may ask, How
                            much water should I be
                            drinking? Remember how I said that our bodies are made up of 60% water, well there is your
                            answer. Take your body weight and multiply that by .60 to find out how many fluid ounces you
                            should try to drink to stay hydrated. Now you don't have to be over the top strict with this
                            and hit that number every single day. As long as you are drinking around that number 5-6
                            days out of the week you will be golden. The more accurate, the better, is an honest thought
                            to everything health & fitness related, but don't let it add stress to your life.
                            <br><br>
                            Say you weigh 175lbs, you would take 175lbs * .60 = 105 fluid ounces of water.
                            <br><br>
                            A tip I would recommend is to buy a 1/2 gallon jug and drink that 1-2 times a day
                            based on what your daily intake is. I find it much easier to fill up a larger container then
                            to re-fill a small bottle 5-6 times a day.<br><br>

                            <em>Side Note: 1 gallon is 128 fluid ounces.</em>
